CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:19 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findperformance_test_fixture.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "performance_test_fixture", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "performance_test_fixture" with any of the following names:

    performance_test_fixtureConfig.cmake
    performance_test_fixture-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "performance_test_fixture" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "performance_test_fixture_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "performance_test_fixture" provides
  a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
